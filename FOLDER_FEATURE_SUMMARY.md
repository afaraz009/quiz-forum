## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```prisma
model Folder {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  name      String
  isDefault Boolean  @default(false)
  userId    String
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  quizzes   Quiz[]   // Relationship to quizzes in this folder
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([userId])
}

model Quiz {
  id           String        @id @default(cuid())
  title        String
  description  String?
  questions    String        // JSON string of QuizQuestion[]
  totalQuestions Int
  userId       String
  user         User          @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  folderId     String?       // Added folder relationship
  folder       Folder?       @relation(fields: [folderId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  attempts     QuizAttempt[]
  createdAt    DateTime      @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime      @updatedAt

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([folderId])       // Added index for folder queries
}
```

### User Experience
1. Students can create folders from the dashboard
2. Students can save new quizzes directly to folders
3. Students can move existing quizzes between folders
4. Students can filter quizzes by folder
5. Default "Uncategorized" folder is automatically created for all users

### Security Considerations
- All folder operations are protected by authentication
- Users can only access their own folders and quizzes
- Proper validation is performed on all API endpoints
- Folder deletion moves quizzes to the default folder to prevent data loss

## Testing
The feature has been tested with the following scenarios:
1. Creating new folders
2. Saving quizzes to specific folders
3. Moving quizzes between folders
4. Deleting folders (quizzes moved to default folder)
5. Filtering quizzes by folder
6. Default folder creation for new users

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements could include:
1. Folder renaming functionality
2. Nested folder structure
3. Folder sharing between users
4. Bulk move operations
5. Folder-based quiz sharing
