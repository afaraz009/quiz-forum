# Quiz Forum Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
**IDE-based fresh analysis** - Analyzing the existing quiz-forum Next.js project

### Current Project State
Based on my analysis of the existing codebase, this appears to be a **Next.js quiz application** with the following core functionality:

- **User authentication system** using NextAuth with credentials provider
- **Quiz creation and management** allowing users to upload JSON files or paste content
- **Interactive quiz taking** with both multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and short-answer text questions
- **User dashboard** showing saved quizzes and attempt history
- **Database persistence** using Prisma ORM with SQLite
- **Quiz attempt tracking** with scoring and results

The application uses modern React patterns (hooks, Context API) with TypeScript, TailwindCSS for styling, and shadcn/ui components for the UI framework.

### Available Documentation Analysis
Currently available documentation:
- ✅ **CLAUDE.md** - Comprehensive project overview with architecture, commands, and technology stack
- ❌ **Tech Stack Documentation** - Basic info available in CLAUDE.md but could be more detailed
- ❌ **Source Tree/Architecture** - Not formally documented beyond CLAUDE.md
- ❌ **API Documentation** - API routes exist but no formal documentation
- ❌ **UX/UI Guidelines** - No formal design system documentation
- ❌ **Technical Debt Documentation** - Not documented

**Recommendation**: The project has good foundational documentation in CLAUDE.md, but lacks formal architectural documentation.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ **New Feature Addition** - Adding comprehensive admin test management system
- **Impact Assessment**: ✅ **Significant Impact** (substantial existing code changes required)

**Enhancement Description**: Adding a complete **Admin Test Management System** that allows you (as instructor) to create standardized tests for all enrolled students, monitor completion in real-time, prevent multiple attempts, and view comprehensive results and scoring analytics in a dashboard format.

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
• Enable instructor to create and publish standardized tests accessible to all registered students
• Implement single-attempt restriction per student per published test  
• Provide comprehensive results dashboard showing all student scores and responses
• Allow management of multiple concurrent tests with separate analytics
• Transform individual quiz practice into structured classroom assessment

**Background Context:**
This enhancement addresses the need to evolve from individual student practice to structured classroom assessment. Currently, students create their own quizzes for practice, but there's no mechanism for instructors to assess all students uniformly or track class-wide performance. This feature will enable proper educational assessment while maintaining the existing individual practice functionality.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

• **FR1**: Admin users can create and publish standardized tests that become accessible to all registered student users without breaking existing individual quiz functionality.

• **FR2**: Published tests enforce single-attempt restrictions per student, preventing multiple submissions while maintaining existing unlimited retries for individual practice quizzes.

• **FR3**: Admin dashboard displays comprehensive test results showing all student scores, completion status, and individual answers for each published test.

• **FR4**: System supports multiple concurrent published tests with separate result tracking and analytics for each test instance.

• **FR5**: Admin users can view aggregated class performance data including score distributions, completion rates, and comparative analytics across multiple tests.

• **FR6**: Student users can access published tests through a dedicated interface while retaining access to existing individual quiz creation and practice functionality.

• **FR7**: Test results are immediately available to admin upon student submission, with real-time updates to the results dashboard.

• **FR8**: Admin can create tests using the same JSON format and question types (MCQ and text-based) as existing individual quizzes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

• **NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics and not impact individual quiz functionality response times.

• **NFR2**: Role-based access control must be implemented securely without exposing admin functionality to student users.

• **NFR3**: Database modifications must be backward compatible with existing quiz and user data structures.

• **NFR4**: Results dashboard must load efficiently even with large numbers of students (100+ concurrent users).

• **NFR5**: Single-attempt enforcement must be reliably maintained across browser sessions and devices.

### Compatibility Requirements

• **CR1**: Existing individual quiz functionality must remain completely unaffected and accessible to all users.

• **CR2**: Current database schema for users, quizzes, and quiz attempts must remain functional without data migration requirements.

• **CR3**: Existing UI/UX patterns and component library (shadcn/ui) must be maintained for consistency.

• **CR4**: Current authentication system (NextAuth) must be extended to support role differentiation without breaking existing user sessions.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Frameworks**: Next.js 15 with React 19, NextAuth.js 4.24.11  
**Database**: Prisma ORM 6.10.0 with SQLite (development)  
**Infrastructure**: Netlify deployment with Edge functions  
**External Dependencies**: shadcn/ui components, TailwindCSS, Radix UI, React Hook Form with Zod validation  

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Prisma schema with new models (PublishedTest, TestAttempt, UserRole) while maintaining foreign key relationships to existing User and Quiz models. Implement soft separation between practice quizzes and published tests through type discrimination.

**API Integration Strategy**: Create new API routes under `/api/admin/` namespace for admin functionality and `/api/test/` for student published test access. Extend existing NextAuth session handling to include role-based permissions checking.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Develop admin dashboard as separate route (`/admin`) with role-guard middleware. Extend existing quiz-taking UI for published tests with attempt restrictions. Reuse existing components (Quiz, QuestionItem) with new props for published test mode.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing API testing patterns to cover new admin endpoints and role-based access control. Add integration tests for single-attempt enforcement and results aggregation.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- `/app/admin/` - Admin dashboard and test management pages
- `/app/test/[testId]/` - Published test taking interface  
- `/components/admin/` - Admin-specific components (TestManager, ResultsDashboard, StudentScores)
- `/lib/admin.ts` - Admin utility functions and permissions
- `/types/admin.ts` - Admin-related TypeScript interfaces

**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components. Prefix admin-related components with `Admin` (AdminDashboard, AdminTestList).

**Coding Standards**: Maintain existing React patterns using hooks and TypeScript strict mode. Follow established shadcn/ui component usage patterns.

**Documentation Standards**: Update CLAUDE.md with new admin routes and API endpoints. Document role-based permissions in code comments.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No changes to existing `npm run build` process. New admin routes will be automatically included in Next.js build.

**Deployment Strategy**: Maintain existing Netlify deployment. Admin functionality deploys as additional routes without requiring separate infrastructure.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing error handling to include admin operations. Add logging for test creation and submission events for audit trail.

**Configuration Management**: Add admin configuration options to environment variables (default admin email, max concurrent tests, etc.).

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Role-based access control implementation complexity
- Single-attempt enforcement across browser sessions/devices
- Performance impact of results aggregation on large datasets

**Integration Risks**:
- Breaking existing user authentication flow  
- Database schema changes affecting existing quiz functionality
- UI consistency between admin and student interfaces

**Deployment Risks**:
- Admin routes accidentally accessible to students
- Database migration issues with existing data
- Performance degradation with concurrent test-taking

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement comprehensive role-checking middleware with fail-safe defaults
- Use database-level constraints for single-attempt enforcement
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of admin functionality
- Create database backup/restore procedures before schema changes
- Add performance monitoring for results dashboard queries

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: **Single Comprehensive Epic** - This enhancement should be structured as one cohesive epic because all components (admin roles, test publishing, single-attempt enforcement, results dashboard) are tightly integrated and interdependent. Breaking into multiple epics would create incomplete functionality and complex integration challenges across epic boundaries.

## Epic 1: Admin Test Management System

**Epic Goal**: Transform the quiz application from individual student practice to comprehensive classroom assessment by implementing admin test creation, student test-taking with single-attempt restrictions, and complete results analytics dashboard.
