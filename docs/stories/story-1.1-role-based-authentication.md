# Story 1.1: Role-Based Authentication Foundation

## Story
As an **instructor**,  
I want **role-based access control integrated into the existing authentication system**,  
so that **I can access admin functionality while students retain their current access patterns**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extend User model with isAdmin boolean field with default false
2. Update NextAuth configuration to include admin role in session data  
3. Create admin middleware for route protection without affecting existing routes
4. Existing user sessions and authentication flow remain completely unchanged
5. Admin users can access both student and admin functionality

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: All existing user authentication flows continue to work identically
- **IV2**: Student users cannot access admin routes and receive appropriate redirects  
- **IV3**: No performance impact on existing login/logout functionality

## Dev Notes
This is the foundation story that must be completed first. It establishes the role-based authentication system that all other stories depend on.

Key technical requirements:
- Extend Prisma User model with isAdmin boolean (default false)
- Update NextAuth session to include admin role
- Create middleware for admin route protection
- Maintain backward compatibility with all existing auth flows

## Testing
- Test existing user login/logout flows remain unchanged
- Test admin users can access admin routes
- Test student users are properly redirected from admin routes
- Test session handling includes role information
- Test middleware route protection works correctly

## Tasks
- [x] Extend User model in Prisma schema with isAdmin field
- [x] Update database with migration for new field
- [x] Modify NextAuth configuration to include admin role in session
- [x] Create admin route protection middleware
- [x] Test existing authentication flows remain unchanged
- [x] Test admin route protection works correctly
- [x] Update existing user to be admin for testing
