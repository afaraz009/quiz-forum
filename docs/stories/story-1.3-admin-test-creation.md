# Story 1.3: Admin Test Creation Interface

## Story
As an **instructor**,
I want **to create and publish tests using familiar JSON format**,
so that **I can create standardized assessments for all students using the same question types I'm familiar with**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin dashboard accessible at /admin route with existing UI patterns
2. Test creation form reuses existing file upload and JSON validation components
3. Test metadata capture (title, description, time limits, publish status)
4. Preview functionality using existing Quiz component in read-only mode
5. Published tests become immediately available to all registered students

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Existing student quiz creation functionality remains unaffected
- **IV2**: JSON validation and error handling behaves identically to existing system
- **IV3**: File upload component maintains existing security and validation patterns

## Dev Notes
This story builds the admin interface for creating published tests, reusing existing components wherever possible to maintain UI consistency.

Key technical requirements:
- Extend existing admin dashboard (/admin) with test management
- Reuse FileUploader component for JSON input
- Create PublishedTest creation API endpoint
- Implement test preview using existing Quiz component
- Add test metadata form (title, description, timeLimit, dueDate)
- Publish/unpublish functionality

## Testing
- Test admin can create and save published tests
- Test JSON validation works with existing patterns
- Test file upload security remains intact
- Test preview functionality works correctly
- Test published tests become available to students
- Test existing student quiz creation remains unchanged

## Tasks
- [x] Create admin test management UI components
- [x] Build test creation form with metadata
- [x] Integrate existing FileUploader component
- [x] Create API endpoint for saving published tests
- [x] Implement test preview functionality
- [x] Add publish/unpublish toggle
- [x] Test integration with existing components
