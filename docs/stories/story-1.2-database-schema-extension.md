# Story 1.2: Database Schema Extension

## Story
As a **developer**,
I want **database models for published tests and restricted attempts**,
so that **the system can support admin test management without affecting existing quiz data**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create PublishedTest model linked to User (admin) with test metadata
2. Create TestAttempt model separate from existing QuizAttempt for published tests
3. Database migration preserves all existing quiz and attempt data
4. Foreign key relationships maintain data integrity
5. Indexes added for performance on test results queries

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: All existing quiz creation and taking functionality works identically
- **IV2**: Existing QuizAttempt data remains accessible and functional
- **IV3**: Database performance for existing operations remains unchanged

## Dev Notes
This story extends the database schema to support published tests while maintaining complete separation from existing individual quiz functionality.

Key technical requirements:
- PublishedTest model for admin-created tests with metadata (title, description, publish status, time limits)
- TestAttempt model for tracking single attempts at published tests
- Maintain foreign key relationships for data integrity
- Add appropriate indexes for performance
- Ensure existing Quiz and QuizAttempt models remain untouched

## Testing
- Test existing quiz creation and attempts continue to work
- Test new models can be created and queried
- Test foreign key relationships work correctly
- Test database performance remains acceptable
- Test data integrity constraints work as expected

## Tasks
- [x] Design PublishedTest model schema
- [x] Design TestAttempt model schema  
- [x] Add models to Prisma schema
- [x] Apply database migration
- [x] Test existing functionality remains intact
- [x] Test new models work correctly
- [x] Add appropriate database indexes

## Dev Agent Record

### Status
Ready for Review

### Agent Model Used
Claude Code (Sonnet 4) - Full Stack Developer (James)

### File List
- **Modified**: prisma/schema.prisma (added PublishedTest and TestAttempt models, added indexes)
- **Created**: scripts/test-new-models.ts (comprehensive test suite for new models)

### Debug Log References
- Database migrations successful (3 migrations applied)
- Comprehensive model testing passed all 5 test scenarios
- Development server running successfully on port 3002
- No compilation errors or TypeScript issues

### Completion Notes
Successfully implemented comprehensive database schema extension:

**PublishedTest Model Features:**
- Admin-created tests with metadata (title, description, timeLimit, dueDate)
- Publication status control (isPublished, publishedAt)
- Support for late submissions (allowLateSubmissions)
- Complete foreign key relationships to User (createdBy)

**TestAttempt Model Features:**
- Single-attempt enforcement via unique constraint (userId + publishedTestId)
- Comprehensive attempt tracking (startedAt, completedAt, isCompleted)
- JSON storage for answers matching existing pattern
- Separate from QuizAttempt to maintain existing functionality

**Performance & Integrity:**
- Added strategic indexes for query performance
- Ensured existing Quiz/QuizAttempt models remain unchanged
- Comprehensive testing verifies all relationships work correctly
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate attempts per user per test

All acceptance criteria met and integration verification tests passed.
