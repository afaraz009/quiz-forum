# Story 1.4: Student Published Test Interface

## Story
As a **student**,
I want **to access published tests alongside my individual quizzes**,
so that **I can take instructor-created assessments while maintaining access to practice quizzes**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Student dashboard shows both "Practice Quizzes" and "Published Tests" sections
2. Published test interface prevents multiple attempts per test per student
3. Test-taking UI reuses existing Quiz and QuestionItem components
4. Clear visual distinction between practice and assessment modes
5. Attempt restriction messaging provides clear feedback to students

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Individual quiz creation and unlimited retake functionality preserved
- **IV2**: Existing dashboard layout and navigation patterns maintained
- **IV3**: Quiz-taking UI behavior identical for practice quizzes

## Dev Notes
This story extends the student experience by adding published test access while preserving all existing functionality. The key is to clearly separate practice from assessment modes.

Key technical requirements:
- Extend student dashboard to show published tests
- Create published test taking interface using existing components
- Implement single-attempt restriction with clear messaging
- Add visual indicators for assessment vs practice modes
- Ensure existing quiz functionality remains untouched

## Testing
- Test student can see and access published tests
- Test single-attempt restriction works correctly
- Test existing quiz creation and taking remains unchanged
- Test visual distinction between modes is clear
- Test error messaging for attempt restrictions

## Tasks
- [x] Extend dashboard to show published tests section
- [x] Create published test listing API endpoint
- [x] Build published test taking interface
- [x] Implement single-attempt restriction logic
- [x] Add visual indicators for assessment mode
- [x] Test integration with existing quiz components
- [x] Test attempt restriction messaging
