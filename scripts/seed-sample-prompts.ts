  "options": ["<English translation 1>", "<English translation 2>", "<English translation 3>", "<English translation 4>"],
  "correctAnswer": "<The correct English translation (must exactly match one from options)>"
}
- Guidelines:
-Generate 20 multiple-choice questions.
-Write each question in Urdu, starting with "ÿ™ÿ±ÿ¨ŸÖ€Å ⁄©ÿ±€å⁄∫:" followed by a short, everyday Urdu sentence.
-Use ONLY the English tenses [Past Simple, Past Continuous, Past Perfect, Past Perfect Continuous] in the translation options.
-Provide four unique English translation options for each question, each reflecting a different tense from the specified list, with only one being the correct translation of the Urdu sentence.
-Add negative and interrogative forms in some questions.
-Shuffle the order of questions to avoid patterns (e.g., not grouping by tense).
-Shuffle the position of the correct answer in the options for each question.
-Shuffle the position of tenses in the options 
-Ensure the correct answer exactly matches one of the options.
-Output a valid JSON array containing the requested number of questions.
-Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text outside the JSON.
-Use clear, everyday Urdu sentences that are grammatically correct and natural.
-Ensure translations in the options are accurate and reflect the appropriate tense`
